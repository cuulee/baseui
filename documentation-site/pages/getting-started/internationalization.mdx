# Internationalization

Base UI supports English as the default language. Following the instructions below, you
can use other languages too.

```javascript
import { LocaleProvider } from 'baseui';
import {huHU} from '{YOUR_PROJECT}/hu.json';
import App from '{YOUR_PROJECT}/app.js';

return (
  <LocaleProvider locale={huHU}>
    <App />
  </LocaleProvider>
);
```

If you'd like to contribute a locale, please send a Pull Request based
on the [en_US](https://github.com/uber-web/baseui/tree/master/src/locale) locale.
